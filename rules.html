		<h1>Rules and Guidelines</h1>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Editing</h2>
		<h3>Collaboration is key</h3>
        <p>Wikis are based on the idea that the crowd, collectively, has a greater sum of knowledge than just one individual. That means collaborating with others is the key to creating a successful community. Collaboration means you work together to build, design, and make decisions. No one person owns or rules a community site. Rather, it is built, supported, and owned by all participating community members.</p>
        <h3>Practice open-mindedness & assume good faith</h3>
        <p>Since sites are open for anyone to edit, users of all skill levels and opinions are welcome to participate. We assume that most people who work on a wiki are trying to help it, not hurt it. If this were not true, a project would be doomed from the beginning. If you think there is a problem, it is best to ask the user about the issue first and then take any additional steps if necessary.</p>
        <p>The same practices can apply to users who visit the site to discuss, read, and comment on a page. Everyone has differing opinions and perspectives on topics, so please practice open-mindedness and assume that not everything out there is written with ill intent.</p>
		<h3>Ask for help</h3>
		<p>If you are confused or need help, just ask! There are a lot of places to seek help all around you on Fandom, including our help pages, Central forums, local admins, and staff. No question is too small!</p>	
		<h3>Talk pages</h3>
		<p>Talk pages can be used as an alternative form of communication when it comes to editing discussion, however we do still recommend editors to discuss upcoming changes on our Discord Server. Talk pages can be created under the dropdown menu on the top right of each page, and are created under the Talk: namespace.</p>
		<p>Talk pages are not intended for commenting or general discussion use, and should be only intended for editing discussion use, so please do not abuse the Talk page functionality for unrelated matters.</p>
		<h3>Report content that infringes on our rules</h3>
		<p>Our staff of volunteers may not always be available to respond immediately to any offending content that gets posted to the site. If you see any offending posts or comments that have been made which infringe upon our listed guidelines, please report the post so our staff can take review the post in question. All reported posts will be reviewed by our staff and corrective action will be taken if necessary. Please note that abuse of the report system, which includes unjustified reporting is not tolerated, and users who abuse the report system may be subject to consequences.</p>
		<p></p>
		<h2>Content Rules and Editing Guidelines</h2>
		<h3>Datamined and Leaked Content</h3>
		<p>The following content is allowed on the site:<br>1. Datamined icons for released items and weapons<br>2. Datamined info for released characters<br>3. Icons and Images<br>4. Talents and Stats<br>5. Voice-Overs and Character Stories<br>The following content is not allowed:<br>Datamined information about unannounced characters or upcoming characters that have not been released yet<br>Info, icons/images, descriptions, stats, etc. for anything that is technically released and accessible in the game, but not actually physically accessible by the player at the current time, meaning there is no way for the player to obtain or view the thing in question without the use of exploits or cheats<br>3D models of characters</p>
		<h3>Leaked Content</h3>
		<p>The following list contains all content that is considered leaked, and therefore prohibited:

			Any screenshot or video that contains leaked content, such as 3D model renders of unreleased characters, weapons, or unreleased character icons
			The mention of an unreleased character's name that has not been announced in any form of official media or writing
			The disclosure of the element type, weapon type, or faction of any unreleased character that cannot be known through the means of official media or writing
			The disclosure of stats of a weapon or skill that cannot be known through the means of official media or writing
			The disclosure of featured banner units or the details of an upcoming banner
			The disclosure of content that comes with unreleased version updates unless announced ahead of time
			Alluding to or referring to leaked content
			Encouraging or promoting leaked content to other users
			Any external link that provides leaked information that infringes upon any of the rules listed above
			Leaks from other HoYoverse titles, including Honkai Impact 3rd and Tears of Themis</p>
		<p>Speculation should only be substantiated with evidence that is based from the currently available content. Users should not base their speculations from previous leaks, or from "rumors" surrounding leaks. If one does not support their opinions or theories with evidence based from available content, the post is subject to deletion, and the user may be warned.</p>
		<p>If you have any questions, please ask a Content Moderator or Administrator before editing or uploading, or else your edits/content will be reverted/deleted.</p>
		<h3>Vandalism</h3>
		<p>Any form of vandalism is not welcome on the Wiki. This includes:

			Inserting false information, inappropriate or unrelated content, spam, or gibberish into pages
			Removing content from pages for no legitimate reason
			Inserting or spamming links to external sites
			Uploading inappropriate images to the site without good reason</p>
		<h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h3></h3>
		<p>Be nice and treat people with respect. Keep discussions civil and be open-minded about differing opinions. Posts that express criticisms are allowed; posts that deliberately incur flame wars are strictly prohibited and will be deleted. Posts that express disagreements of a user are allowed; posts that berate or insult a user in said disagreement are strictly prohibited.

			Please refrain from using profanity on the site. If your post or comment is found to have used unnecessary profanity, the post or comment in question is subject to modification or deletion, and the user may be warned.
			
			If someone is making disrespectful comments towards you or other users, please use the report function, and one of the Content or Thread Moderators will take a look at the offending post. Engaging in flame wars with other users is highly discouraged and will likely result in the involved users receiving a warning if you are found participating in the toxicity. User walls are not exempt from this rule, and you will be warned if you are attacking someone on their user wall.
			
			Do not make posts personal or post personal information. Wikis are meant to be a place to collaborate with others on topics that excite you. Pages meant just as an attack on someone will be removed. This includes content posted in articles and messages to other users, and includes threats towards miHoYo, the characters, or other players.</p>
